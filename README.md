# Energy-City-1.0
A stand-alone program in Python intended to raise awareness of the negative aspects of overusing fossil fuels. A one class program with many members and methods. 

You are given a randomly generated size city with varying amounts of power plants, turbines, etc. It is your goal to double your population, but if everyone dies, then you lose. Disasters will come randomly, and having too much pollution will be dangerous, even if those coal power plants are cheap! 

To run: 
```
python Energy.py
```
